# This is adapted from a benchmark written by John Ellis and Pete Kovac
# of Post Communications.
# It was modified by Hans Boehm of Silicon Graphics.
#
# This is no substitute for real applications. No actual application
# is likely to behave in exactly this way. However, this benchmark was
# designed to be more representative of real applications than other
# Java GC benchmarks of which we are aware.
# It attempts to model those properties of allocation requests that
# are important to current GC techniques.
# It is designed to be used either to obtain a single overall performance
# number, or to give a more detailed estimate of how collector
# performance varies with object lifetimes. It prints the time
# required to allocate and collect balanced binary trees of various
# sizes. Smaller trees result in shorter object lifetimes. Each cycle
# allocates roughly the same amount of memory.
# Two data structures are kept around during the entire process, so
# that the measured performance is representative of applications
# that maintain some live in-memory data. One of these is a tree
# containing many pointers. The other is a large array containing
# double precision floating point numbers. Both should be of comparable
# size.
#
# The results are only really meaningful together with a specification
# of how much memory was used. It is possible to trade memory for
# better time performance. This benchmark should be run in a 32 MB
# heap, though we don't currently know how to enforce that uniformly.
#
# Unlike the original Ellis and Kovac benchmark, we do not attempt
# measure pause times. This facility should eventually be added back
# in. There are several reasons for omitting it for now.  The original
# implementation depended on assumptions about the thread scheduler
# that don't hold uniformly. The results really measure both the
# scheduler and GC. Pause time measurements tend to not fit well with
# current benchmark suites. As far as we know, none of the current
# commercial Java implementations seriously attempt to minimize GC pause
# times.
#
# Known deficiencies:
# - No way to check on memory use
# - No cyclic data structures
# - No attempt to measure variation with object size
# - Results are sensitive to locking cost, but we dont
#   check for proper locking
